<h3> Framework: Face conflict early</h3>
<p>Facing conflict early is the equivalent to weeding a flower bed regularly. Left too long and the roots grow stronger and what would have been a slightly uncomfortable but net positive conversation now becomes something bigger and more dangerous.</p>
<p>The longer a conflict is left unaddressed the stronger it becomes, just like a small debt ballooning with fees and interest over time.</p>
<p>Which is why I find myself looking for weeds regularly.</p>
<p>This was very unnatural for me initially as I grew up in an Indian household in Australia where being so upfront does not fit in with either culture. It was only after living in Germany for a couple years that I could appreciate the upfront candour of my new hosts, and learn from it.</p>
<p>Viewing conflicts this way has given me greater freedom to focus on the things that matter while not letting those things that upset me take over any significant part of my headspace. It’s also led to much closer relationships as addressing conflicts in this manner gives both sides the opportunity to improve.</p>
<p>I find myself repeating various analogies for this one, beside weeding a garden I think it’s also like brushing your teeth regularly to avoid having serious work done by a dentist, or in my experience also like trying to cut drag in a stroke to swim faster without any additional force.</p>
<p>Ok, I admit, some of my analogies are not great.</p>
