<h3> Framework: Open</h3>
<p>In almost all scenarios it’s better to be more open than less open. By open I’m referring to one's motives, ambitions, problems and plans.</p>
<p>The reason for being so open is to give people an opportunity to help you. Given our individual experiences, connections and ways of viewing the world are so different it’s impossible to know exactly how someone might be able to help you but by being open they have the opportunity to use all of that accumulated life experience to help you.</p>
<p>The reason these two things (being open + people helping you) work so nicely together is due to the simple fact that <u>people are good</u>. People are well intentioned and more often than not they will help you. Sometimes in ways you could not have imagined or predicted yourself.</p>
<p>So if you find me over sharing, it’s because I strongly believe that <u>people are good</u>, and so I’m opening up for help. It’s selfish, but it’s also helped me build much stronger relationships.</p>
