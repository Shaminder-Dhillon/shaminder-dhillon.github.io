<h3> Framework: Be very fast</h3>
<p>If you see me changing my opinion often, it’s because of this part of the framework.</p>
<p>Most decisions should be made very quickly, especially decisions which have very low downsides and are easily correctable. The reason for this is that the cost of waiting to make most decisions outweighs the downside of being wrong and subsequently course correcting.</p>
<p>The cumulative value of quick decision making and quick course correction is huge when applied across all decisions where the downside of being wrong is low.</p>
<p>For a very long time I was on the wrong side of this equation. I’d let low downside decisions pend for months at a time. Just waiting for enough info before making a move. Now I hope I’m on the other end of the spectrum, I’m making decisions much faster and am subsequently wrong a lot more often, but am much better for it.</p>
<p>At the same time for decisions that do have a much higher downside of being wrong or are not easily irreversible I get to have much more of my headspace to focus on them. I’m happy to procrastinate on those decisions as the procrastination lets the thought marinate. I also feel less guilty procrastinating about these particular decisions as I know the cost of being wrong is high enough to set aside the incremental headspace.</p>
<p>It’s especially important to be fast as our time is limited. In 2019 the United Nations estimated the global life expectancy average was 72.6 years. There are various life expectancy calculators, I used the first one on Google to calculate my one is 89 years, with a 75% chance I make it to 81 years. There is also a nice Twitter bot which Tweets the % of the year that has been completed to keep us updated.</p>
<p>The purpose of this is not to be grim, but to have a constant denominator for weighing how much time any particular decision should take. It’s even more important to be fast when you consider it’s not just your own time that is limited but that being slow in decision making takes headspace away from more meaningful areas of life like family and friends.</p>
<p>When I was 18 I started my first formal job while going to university, a trader at the company I worked for shared a piece of writing with me which I’ve kept and added to along the way:</p>
<p><b>Time will not wait for you</b></p>
<p>From the cry of the newborn, through to the first spoken word. From your first day at school, and then at work. One minute you're a thirty-something, then you were reborn at forty. Your half-century rushes by, and soon you're a pensioner.</p>
<p>And all along the way, you're waiting for it to happen; you can feel it; you're special. You're not like all the others. Like that young kid who's really a Prince, you're waiting for your turn in the spotlight. But it never comes.</p>
<p>It's not just the policemen who soon begin to look young. You realize that you're not only too old to be the next big thing in tennis or athletics, but that even the ageing President or Prime Minister is younger than you.</p>
<p>You look around, and the boy up the street is running a big business, your own boss is two decades younger than you, and the only thing big you can boast about is your ever-expanding waistline. </p>
<p>In short, life has passed you by. You never reached your potential; you never achieved your goals. You missed the boat; you live the ordinary life of the ordinary person you are.</p>
<p>But at least you're a decent person - you don't lie, or steal. You have a kind nature. And you did your best. Or did you? Did you really go that extra mile in search of your dream, or was it always simply that, because you just sat back and waited for it to happen? Well, my friend, you get no second chances in this life, and you quickly learn that time waits for no man.</p>
