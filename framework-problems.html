<h3> Framework: Choosing my problems</h3>
<p> Consciously choosing my problems keeps me satisfied. I often repeat that if I do not pick my problems then my problems will pick me. So if I'm going to have problems anyway, then I might as well pick the most meaningful ones. Or at least the ones which are most satisfying to work on.</p>
<p>The problem that I'm concentrating most of my head space on at the moment is building a business. Specifically a business in Berlin. Choosing this problem as my core problem has some major associated problems as well i.e. being away from my family and friends in Sydney. There are a couple reasons I choose to do this outside Sydney but that is another topic in itself. </p>
<p>But this main problem is also very satisfying. Why? Because most of the problems that I have to deal with on a day-to-day basis are stems of the chosen high satisfaction problem. So no matter how rough any one of these associated problems become, I know I have chosen it proactively and if at any point it is no longer satisfying to work on then I have the power to change it. Which is very empowering and motivates me to focus harder on it.</p>
<p>Also, knowing what the major associated problems are I can proactively work to manage those as I pursue the high satisfaction problem.</p>
<p>So when I'm faced with a new problem, I like to zoom out and ask if it's part of my core or network of associated problems before deciding to spend time on it. Using this framework I've reduced the time I spend on unsatisfying problems.</p>
<p>This has been the most constructive lens I have added to my framework so far. I wish I had been introduced to thinking this way earlier.</p>
