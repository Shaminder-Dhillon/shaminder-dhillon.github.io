  <p> If you are in Berlin please order some fresh Indian sweets by following the link below. 
    If you are not in Berlin then you should still order some sweets and I'll donate them.

  <p> The next question by most of the non-Indian community is what should I order? So just go ahead and add 1kg of Boondi Ladoos and 1 x Mix Mithai. </p>

<h3> Starting </h3>
<p> Up to this point I have exclusively been writing in private. But now I feel the need to write more in public than in my private logs so I'll be adding more content here. </p>

<h3> About</h3>
<p> I live in Berlin and am building <a href="https://joinorder.de">JoinOrder</a>. I was born in India and my family emigrated to Sydney, Australia when I was 4 years old. I studied Finance & Accounting at UNSW. </p>
