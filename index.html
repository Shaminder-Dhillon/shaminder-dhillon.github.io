  <h3> Starting </h3>
  <p> Up to this point I have exclusively been writing in private. Now I feel the need to write more in public than in my private logs so I'll be adding more content here. </p>

  <h3> About</h3>
  <p> I live in Berlin and am building <a href="https://joinorder.de">JoinOrder</a>. I was born in India and my family emigrated to Sydney, Australia when I was 4 years old. I studied Finance & Accounting at UNSW. </p>

  <h3> Writing</h3>

  <p> 
    <i>Below are a couple points on how I'm currently approaching life. I've always been curious about how others are making decisions, so I thought I'd share my current framework. My goal in sharing these openly is to have more meaningful relationships.</i> 
    <br>1. <a href="framework-problems.html">Choosing my problems</a>
    <br>2. <a href="framework-fast.html">Be very fast</a>
    <br>3. <a href="framework-conflict.html">Face conflict early</a>
    <br>4. <a href="framework-open.html">Open</a>
    <br>5. <a href="framework-revealing.html">Revealing lies</a>
  </p>

  <h3> Books & Art</h3>

  <p> 
    <p> <a href="books.html">Here is a list</a> of some books that I've enjoyed reading.</p>
    <p> <a href="art.html">Here is a list</a> of some art pieces that I've found striking.</p>
