<h3> Framework: Revealing Lies</h3>
<p>There are two distinct types of lies and revealing them lets you focus your energy on things that matter.</p>
<p><b>Lies by omission:</b> Where you leave out important information or fail to correct a pre-existing misconception in order to hide the truth from others.</p>
<p><b>Lies by deceit:</b> Where you actively present false facts.</p>
<p>Lies by omission are particularly interesting as they are very easy to do. Almost too easy, and they feel like they are doing no damage, maybe even avoiding damage.</p>
<p>However they have strong compounding characteristics i.e. the longer the omission takes place the harder it becomes to reveal and the more damage it does when revealed.</p>
<p>Knowing and understanding these two characteristics of lies of omission provides a strong motivating factor in revealing them as soon as you become aware.</p>
<p>The benefits are again selfish, reveling your lies lets you focus more of your energy on the things that matter.</p>
