<h3> Compounding</h3>
<p> Compounding is the closest thing to magic.</p>
<p> A simple calculation which most people have seen on a Instagram meme of some type is:</p>
<p> 1.01^365 ≈ 37.8</p>
<p> 0.99^365 ≈ 0.03</p>
<p> i.e. The impact of a 1% improvement or deterioration applied across 365 cycles is very powerful.</p>
<p> <a href="framework-fast.html">Being Fast</a> helps to find improvement or deterioration cycles quickly and compounding cycles turns into results which look magical. I like to look at 90 day cycles so lets repeat the calculation:</p>
<p> Across 90 cycles:</p>
<p> 1.01^90 ≈ 2.44</p>
<p> 0.99^90 ≈ 0.41</p>
<p> Across 120 cycles:</p>
<p> 1.01^120 ≈ 3.30</p>
<p> 0.99^120 ≈ 0.30</p>
<p> Across 180 cycles:</p>
<p> 1.01^180 ≈ 6.00</p>
<p> 0.99^180 ≈ 0.16</p>
<p> You get the point. I say cycles and not days as loops are only as long as you make them or nature defines. This is true across categories like fitness, product development or user acquisition.</p>
<p> To make magic its important to focus on three things:</p>
<p> 1. Identify if a cycle is of improvement or deterioration</p>
<p> 2. Know the cycle length (e.g. a day, an hour), shorter the better</p>
<p> 3. Do whatever it takes to let the compounding carry on</p>
